- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned
I learned how to make forms accessible to those with disabilities. It was a great learning experience and introduced me to a completely new subject in front-end development.

### Continued development
I wish to learn more about accessibility in the future and incorporate them in projects.

### Useful resources
- [Accessibility Developer Guide](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/examples/forms/required/) - The semantic and accessible way to include asterisk to indicate required form fields.
